## Creating list of number of users who authored at least 5 posts in pairs of subreddits: 

#legacySQL
SELECT t1.subreddit, t2.subreddit, SUM(1) as NumOverlaps
FROM (SELECT subreddit, author, COUNT(1) as cnt 
     FROM (TABLE_QUERY([fh-bigquery:reddit_comments],
         'table_id CONTAINS "2017_" AND length(table_id) >= 5'))
     GROUP BY subreddit, author HAVING cnt > 10) t1
     
JOIN (SELECT subreddit, author, COUNT(1) as cnt 
     FROM(TABLE_QUERY([fh-bigquery:reddit_comments],
         'table_id CONTAINS "2017_" AND length(table_id) >= 5'))
     GROUP BY subreddit, author HAVING cnt > 10) t2
     
ON t1.author=t2.author
WHERE t1.subreddit!=t2.subreddit
GROUP BY t1.subreddit, t2.subreddit
